# Assignment Tasks

Create a comprehensive literature review examining the dual role of artificial intelligence in the workplace: as an augmentative tool for human labor and as an autonomous alternative. The review should synthesize findings from academic research, industry implementations, and venture capital perspectives to investigate:

1. The technical foundations, current capabilities, and future trajectories of AI agents and assistants
2. The dichotomy between technical and marketing definitions of AI agency
3. Enterprise implementations across major technology companies and consulting firms
4. Venture capital insights into market dynamics and implementation patterns
5. Practical implications for quality control in automated historical research, particularly in family history social network analysis

The review should integrate perspectives from:

- Academic papers and preprints (particularly from arXiv)
- Industry white papers and technical documentation
- Commercial product analyses
- Venture capital research and market analyses
- Professional services implementation case studies

The end use case focuses on quality control for automated historical research related to family history social network analysis, with particular attention to:

- The reliability of AI agents in historical research contexts
- The balance between automation and human oversight
- Best practices for implementing AI assistance in genealogical research
- Implications for social network analysis in historical contexts

## Writing Style

### Structure and Organization

The literature review should be organized thematically rather than chronologically or by source type. Each paragraph should:

- Begin with a clear topic sentence that introduces the main idea
- Present supporting evidence and analysis
- End with a transition that connects to the next topic
- Maintain coherent flow between paragraphs and sections

### Language and Tone

Write in a clear, professional style that bridges academic rigor with accessibility:

- Use precise, specific language while avoiding unnecessary jargon
- Define technical terms on first use
- Maintain an objective, analytical voice
- Present balanced perspectives when discussing contrasting views
- Use active voice predominantly, with passive voice only when emphasis on the action rather than the actor is warranted

### Presentation of Information

Present all information in well-structured prose paragraphs:

- Transform any list-like information into flowing narrative text
- Integrate examples and evidence smoothly into paragraphs
- Use transitional phrases to connect ideas within and between paragraphs
- Present complex ideas progressively, building understanding through careful explanation

### Critical Analysis

Demonstrate scholarly depth through:

- Synthesis of multiple sources to support key points
- Evaluation of the strength and limitations of different approaches
- Identification of patterns, themes, and gaps in the literature
- Clear articulation of how different sources relate to each other
- Discussion of implications for the field of AI-assisted historical research

### Accessibility

While maintaining academic rigor, ensure the writing is accessible to an educated general audience:

- Break down complex concepts into understandable components
- Use concrete examples to illustrate abstract ideas
- Provide context for specialized knowledge
- Create clear logical progression of ideas
- Use analogies where appropriate to explain technical concepts

## Citations

Please follow the Chicago Author-Date citation style as detailed in `LitReview/citation-guide.md`. This ensures:

1. Consistent formatting of in-text citations
2. Properly structured bibliography entries
3. Appropriate handling of different source types (academic papers, preprints, blogs)
4. Clear attribution of all sources

For specific examples and formatting rules, refer to the citation guide.
