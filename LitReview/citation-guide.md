# Chicago Author-Date Citation Guide

This guide outlines the rules and provides examples for citations and bibliography entries following the Chicago Author-Date style.

## In-Text Citations

### Basic Rules

1. Include author's last name and publication year in parentheses
2. Add page numbers after year, separated by comma, when directly quoting
3. Use semicolons to separate multiple citations within same parentheses
4. For works with no author, use short title
5. For works with 3+ authors, use first author followed by "et al."

### Examples

- Single author: (Smith 2020)
- Two authors: (Smith and Jones 2020)
- Three or more authors: (Smith et al. 2020)
- Specific page: (Smith 2020, 45)
- Multiple pages: (Smith 2020, 45-48)
- Multiple citations: (Smith 2020; Jones 2019)
- No author, use short title: ("Artificial Intelligence" 2020)
- Organization as author: (Stanford University 2020)

## Bibliography Entries

### Basic Format

```
Author's Last Name, First Name. Year. "Title of Article." Journal Name Volume (Issue): Page range. DOI/URL.
```

### Examples

```

#### Book

```

### Special Cases

1. **Multiple Authors**

   - List up to 10 authors in bibliography
   - For more than 10 authors, list first 7 followed by "et al."

2. **No Author**

   - Begin entry with title
   - Use organization name if available

3. **Multiple Works by Same Author**

   - Order chronologically
   - Use three-em dashes (———) to replace author name in subsequent entries

4. **DOIs and URLs**
   - Include DOI when available
   - For online sources without DOI, include URL
   - Access dates are not required unless content is likely to change

## Tips for Managing Citations

1. Use reference management software (e.g., Zotero, Mendeley)
2. Keep detailed notes of all sources during research
3. Save PDFs and web pages of all sources
4. Document page numbers during note-taking
5. Verify all URLs before final submission

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Inconsistent formatting between in-text citations and bibliography
2. Missing page numbers for direct quotes
3. Incorrect alphabetization in bibliography
4. Forgetting to include DOI/URL when available
5. Inconsistent capitalization in titles
